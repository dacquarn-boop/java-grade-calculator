# Java Grade Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates a student's final grade based on weighted assignments and exam inputs. I created this project to practice methods, input validation, and organizing logic in a clean way.

## Features
- Enter assignment and exam marks  
- Weighted grade calculation  
- Basic input validation  
- Clear and simple output  

## Technologies Used
- Java  
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any editor)  

## What I Learned
- Using methods to organize code  
- Reading user input  
- Validating values  
- Basic calculations and logic design  

## Future Improvements
- Add GUI version  
- Save previous grade calculations  
- Add categories like labs, quizzes, etc.
